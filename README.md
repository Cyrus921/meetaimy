To-Do List:

- Add a delete button for each row in the list and implement a corresponding delete endpoint in the controller.
- Add an edit button for each row in the list, which will:
  - Convert the create form into an edit form when clicked.
  - Change the create button into an edit button dynamically.
    
- Implement date-based filtering for both the list and the graph.
- Add a toggle switch to switch the graph display between price and amount.
